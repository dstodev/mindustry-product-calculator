A tool that can calculate how many factories you need for each ingredient up to a specified "goal" item and rate.

This implementation is probably really inefficient. It avoids solutions that involve linear programming because I'm not sure how to apply those concepts to this sort of problem yet.

It also doesn't have any UI yet. Since this is a tempororary tool until I implement a more robust solution, I've just been inspecting the top-level Request object in debug mode to use the calculated metrics.
